Active Development
------------------
This directory houses items that we are working on in order to improve 
your experience using the non compass version of skeleton sass. Currently
we are working on:

* Multi-stop support for background linear and radial gradients

If you wish to contribute to the development of these items please fork
the file on github. Be sure you **test** your functions/mixins
before you submit them. Working demos will get you a mention :)

A speical note about the chagelog. This log will be incremental and probably
won't reflect all of the changes that happen inside of the dev file because
the changes might be too numerous to log. During each major/minor release
a more detailed log will be available in the master branch.
