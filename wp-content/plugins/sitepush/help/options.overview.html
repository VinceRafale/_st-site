<p>SitePush helps you to easily move files and database content between different versions of a site. For example, it allows you to push code from a development site to a live site, or create and edit content on a non-public version of a site, and push all code or content in one batch when you are ready.</p>

<p>As an administrator, you can configure SitePush and push all theme and plugin code and all database tables. You can give non-admin users restricted access, so they can only push site content, and not options or code. See <i>SitePush Capabilities</i> settings section below.</p>

<p>The configuration files hold core information about each SitePush site, such as paths sites and database config. See the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sitepush/installation" target="_blank">SitePush installation instructions</a> for information about each config file. You must define paths to the config files, but all either options can either be left blank or have a default value.</p>
